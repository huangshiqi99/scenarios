# Create User Account

The `useradd` command creates a user account in the Linux platform, for example:

```bash
sudo useradd username
```

## Create A Normal User

## Create A User With Group

When using the `sudo useradd joker` command, create a new user account with the same `joker` group. However, sometimes we want to create a new user account with a different group.

Now, we will create a new user called `joker1` with a group named `public`.

## Create A User With Custom Home Directory

Normally, creating a new user will be associated with a home directory. For example, if you create a new user called `joker`, it will be associated with a directory called `/home/joker`.

However, you will encounter problems when you create a new user with a custom home directory. Fortunately, the `useradd` command can do this.

Now, let's create a new user called `joker2` with a custom home directory `/home/shiyanlou`.

## Create A User Without A Home Directory

In addition to the home directory, sometimes we want to create a new user account without a home directory. For example `ngnx` user, it's only used to manage processes.

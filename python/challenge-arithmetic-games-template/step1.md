# Sum of Squares

Given an integer `n`, calculate the sum of the squares of the first `n` positive integers and print the result.

Formula:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2$$

## TODO

- Completing `sum_of_squares.py`

## Requirements

- Use only the following arithmetic operators in your solution: +, -, \*, /, //, %, \*\*
- The program should take one argument, an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^4), and print the output to the console.
- No modules can be imported.

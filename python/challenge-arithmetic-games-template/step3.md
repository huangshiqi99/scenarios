# Sum of Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence goes as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on. In mathematical terms, the `n`th Fibonacci number is defined as:

```scss
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1
```

Given an integer `n`, calculate the sum of the `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence and print the result.

Formula:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} F(i) = F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + ... + F(n)$$

## TODO

- Completing `sum_of_fibonacci.py`

## Requirements

- Use only the following arithmetic operators in your solution: +, -, \*, /, //, %, \*\*
- The program should take one argument, an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^4), and print the output to the console.
- No modules can be imported.

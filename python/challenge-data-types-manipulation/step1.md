# String Manipulation

Given a string ,write a new string comprehension that creates a new string containing only the operations on the old string.
the syntax of a string comprehension is:

```python
new_string=[expression for item in old_string]
-in this step,expression is a function that converts the old string, upper case, to lowercase and in reverse order and replaces the first old string with the second   old string.
```

## TODO

- Completing `string_manipulation.py`

## Requirements

- Use only the string operations to solve the problem.
- No modules can be imported.

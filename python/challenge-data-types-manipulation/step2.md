# List Operations

Given a list of integers,write a new list comprehension that creates a new list containing only the operations on the old list.
the syntax of a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list=[expression for item in old_list]
-in this step,expression is a function that converts each old list to ascend and de-merge the old list.
```

## TODO

- Completing `list_operations.py`

## Requirements

- Use only the list operations to solve the problem.
- No modules can be imported.

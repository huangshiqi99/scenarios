# Dictionary Operations

Given a dictionary,write a new dictionary comprehension that creates a new dictionary containing only the operations on the dictionary.

```python
new_dictionary=[expression for item in old_dictionary]
-in this step,expression is a function that converts a key-value pair to add and remove.
```

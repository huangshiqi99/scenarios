# Tuple Operations

Given a tuple,write a new tuple comprehension that creates a new tuple containing only the operations on the tuple.
the syntax of a tuple comprehension is:

```python
new_tuple=[expression for item in old_tuple]
-in this step,expression is a function that converts the old tuple to list and ascend,convert the sorted list back to a new tuple.
```

## TODO

- Completing `tuple_operations.py`

## Requirements

- Use only the tuple operations to solve the problem.
- No modules can be imported.

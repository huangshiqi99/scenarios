# Dictionaries

The dictionary is a mutable container model and can store objects of any type.

Each key-value pair is separated by a colon, and each pair is separated by a comma, with the entire dictionary enclosed in parenthesis.

```python
d = {key1 : value1, key2 : value2, key3 : value3 }
```

In the dictionary, the key must be unique, but the value can be the same.

## Open the Python Shell

Open the Python shell by typing the following command in the terminal.

```bash
python3
```

## Create

```python
dict1 = {'name': 'James', "age": 23, "address": "New York"}
dict2 = {} # crated an empty dictionary
```

## Index

We can access a key-value pair by using put the key in `[]` or by function `get`.

```python
print(dict1["name"]) # Output: James
print(dict2["name"]) # Output: KeyError: 'name'
print(dict2.get("name")) # Output: None
```

If the key is not in the dictionary, `dict[key]` will raise a KeyError exception, But we can use `dict.get(key)` to get `None` if the key is not in `dict`.

## Modify

Adding new content to a dictionary is done by assigning a dictionary's key. Modifying the content of a dictionary is done by using `dict[key] = new_value`:

```python
dict2["name"] = "Lily"
dict1["name"] = "Bob"
```

## Delete

We can use only one operation for deleting a key-value pair by using the method `del dict[key]` or `dict.clear()` to empty a dictionary:

```python
del dict1["name"]
print(dict1) # Output: {'age': 23, 'address': 'New York'}

dict2.clear()
print(dict2) # Output: {}
```

# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use Python's for loop statements and the `range()` function to iterate over a sequence of elements. You learned the syntax for for loops and the `range()` function, and saw examples of using them to iterate over lists, strings, tuples, and sequences of numbers. You also learned how to use nested for loops to iterate over nested sequences.

Now that you have learned the basics of for loops and the `range()` function, you can use these tools to perform tasks such as processing data, generating outputs, and more.

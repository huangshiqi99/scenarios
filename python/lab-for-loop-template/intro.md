# For Loop

In this lab, you will learn how to use `for` loop statements and the `range()` function in Python. For loop statements allow you to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list or a string. The `range()` function is a built-in function that returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, increments by 1 (also by default), and ends at a specified number.

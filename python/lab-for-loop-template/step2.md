# the Range() Function

The `range()` function is a built-in function in Python that returns a sequence of numbers. The syntax for the `range()` function is as follows:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

Where `start` is the starting number of the sequence (default is 0), `stop` is the ending number of the sequence (not included), and `step` is the increment between each number in the sequence (default is 1).

You can use the `range()` function in a for loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers. For example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

You can also specify a `start` and `stop` value for the `range()` function:

```python
for i in range(2, 5):
    print(i)
```

You can even specify a step value:

```python
for i in range(2, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

# Print Hello World

"Hello World" is a simple program that prints "Hello World" to the screen. It is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Congratulations! You have just written your first Python program.

`print()` is a function that prints the value inside the parentheses to the screen. In this case, the value is `"Hello World"`. The value inside the parentheses is called an argument. The argument can be a string, a number, or a variable. In this case, the argument is a string.

String and number are two different types of data. We will learn more about "Data Types" in the next step.

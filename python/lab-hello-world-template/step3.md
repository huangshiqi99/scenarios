# Data Types

Data Types is a very important concept in programming. It is the foundation of all programming languages. In this step, we will learn about the most common data types in Python.

## String

A string is a sequence of characters. It can be a word, a sentence, or a paragraph. In Python, a string is surrounded by double quotes or single quotes. For example, `"Hello World"` and `'Hello World'` are both valid strings.

```python
print("Hello World")
print('Hello World')
```

## Number

A number is a value that can be used in mathematical operations. In Python, there are two types of numbers: integer and float. An integer is a whole number. A float is a number with a decimal point. For example, `42` is an integer, and `3.14` is a float.

```python
print(42)
print(3.14)
```

## Boolean

A boolean is a value that can be either `True` or `False`. It is often used to represent the result of a comparison. For example, `1 < 2` is `True`, and `1 > 2` is `False`.

```python
print(1 < 2)
print(1 > 2)
```

## Type

We can use the `type()` function to check the type of a value. For example, `type("Hello World")` returns `str`, which means string. `type(42)` returns `int`, which means integer. `type(3.14)` returns `float`, which means float. `type(True)` returns `bool`, which means boolean.

```python
print(type("Hello World"))
print(type(42))
print(type(3.14))
print(type(True))
```

Python has more data types than the ones we have learned in this step. We will learn more about them soon.

# Variables

A variable is a name that refers to a value. For example, `x = 42` creates a variable named `x` that refers to the value `42`. We can use the variable name to refer to the value later. For example, `print(x)` prints the value `42`.

```python
x = 42
print(x)
```

We can also change the value of a variable. For example, `x = 42` creates a variable named `x` that refers to the value `42`. `x = 3.14` changes the value of `x` to `3.14`.

```python
x = 42
print(x)
x = 3.14
print(x)
```

We can also use a variable to refer to another variable. For example, `x = 42` creates a variable named `x` that refers to the value `42`. `y = x` creates a variable named `y` that refers to the same value as `x`, which is `42`.

```python
x = 42
print(x)
y = x
print(y)
```

## Variable Name

A variable name can be any sequence of characters. However, there are some rules:

- A variable name cannot start with a number.
- A variable name cannot contain spaces.
- A variable name cannot contain special characters such as `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `-`, `+`, `=`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `\`, `|`, `;`, `:`, `"`, `'`, `<`, `>`, `,`, `.`, `/`, `?`.

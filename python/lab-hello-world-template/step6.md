# Python Scripts

Except for Python Interpreter, you can also run Python scripts. Python scripts are files with `.py` extension. Let's create a Python script called `hello.py` and run it.

## Create a Python Script

You can create a Python script using any text editor.

Or you can use the `touch` command to create a file called `hello.py`.

```bash
cd ~
touch hello.py
```

## Write Python Code

Open `hello.py` in your favorite text editor and write the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Run Python Script

```python
python hello.py
```

Output:

```python
Hello, World!
```
